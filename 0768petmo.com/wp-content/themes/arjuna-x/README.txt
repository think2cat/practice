Important notes about this theme:
---------------------------------------------------

* The two menus that are supported by this theme do NOT extend to more than one line. If you have more menu items and they don't fit, the theme has to be customized to accommodate your needs. Generally speaking, it is good practice to keep the options that a user of your website has limited. If you find that you have too many top categories, we advise to minimize the amount of top categories and create your category logic more intelligently and *user-friendly*. Besides, if you use sub categories, they will be shown in a dropdown menu as supported by Arjuna.


About IE6 Support:
---------------------------------------------------

Obviously, the IE6 version of this theme looks a little different than the version displayed in modern browsers. We had tried to simulate the modern version as much as possible but due to the nature of the IE6 rendering engine, we had to make certain decisions to cut down on some visual elements (layout remains completely the same!). The only alternative that we considered for a short time was to use GIF transparency, however, the graphics looked jagged at many areas so we decided to create an IE6 only version of the theme with a simpler background than the original. We believe the result is more than acceptable. Remember the horribly designed websites that had been created back in the days where IE6 was launched? This is definitely not one of them.
Nonetheless, we still hope that IE6 will rest in peace soon.


Changelog:

- Localization: Italian has been updated to 1.3.7.
- Localization: Hungarian has been updated to 1.3.7.
- Localizatoin: German has been improved.
1.3.7
- Change: The include and exclude boxes are now larger in height, making it less awkward to work with a lot of categories/pages.
- Fix: Added better support for WPML when excluding pages or categories in the menus. Arjuna now excludes translated versions of selected pages/categories as well.

1.3.6
- Change: Improved the admin options page of Arjuna to allow users to browse through the many options more easily.
- Localization: German has been updated to 1.3.5.
- Localization: Chinese has been updated to 1.3.5.
1.3.5
- Localization: Romanian (1.3.4) has been added.
- Localization: French has been updated to 1.3.3.
- Fix: Pagination did not work for posts (only pages). Note: The pagination for posts and pages is not formatting like the comment pagination and the native archive page pagination of Arjuna. This is mostly due to some WordPress limitations. If the community would greatly appreciate if this feature be fully implemented, please vote for it on our roadmap.
1.3.4
- Fix: The default setup with the sidebar having a normal width and being on the right caused issues with the display.
1.3.3
- Localization: German has been updated to 1.3.
- Localization: Brazilian has been updated to 1.3.2.
- Change: Improved the display of numbered and bulleted lists. Nested lists now show different list styles to help separate them visually. In addition, the margins have been altered slightly.
1.3.2
- Localization: Italian has been updated to 1.3.
- Fix: The new exclude pages/categories feature had some errors.
1.3
- New: It's now possible to hide comments completely, including the Comments section and the buttons, if comments are disabled for posts or pages.
- New: You can now exclude pages and categories from both header menus. It's pretty basic right now due a number of limitations imposed by the default WordPress functions. Therefore, the admin currently doesn't show any hierarchy information, but it should suffice for most purposes for now.
- New: You can now disable the info bar of static pages. This will render the title of static WordPress pages without the author name and the date it has been published. (Note: The info bar is turned off by default now!)
- New: Added a Facebook button to the sidebar button collection.
- New: You can now disable the labels next to the sidebar buttons (for the RSS, Twitter and Facebook button).
- New: Added two new header colors, Sea Green and Khaki.
- Change: The comment pagination has finally been implemented properly. It does not display any longer if no comment pages are available or if comment pagination has been disabled.
- Change: Added a few additional checks for the twitter URL. 
- Change: Changed the background color of the pagination bar on top of the posts to fit slightly better than the previous grayish background.
- Change: The names of the widget bars of the sidebar have been changed. Note: This might mean that you need to reassign your widgets if you are upgrading Arjuna.
- Fix: Bullet lists and numbered lists in the content of posts rendered with no white space below them.
- Fix: Some international blogs with a language that has characters not part of the standard ASCII table seemed to cause major rendering issues in several browsers, mostly Internet Explorer. Arjuna is now encoded in UTF-8.
- Localization: Slovak (1.2) has been added.
1.2.5
- Localization: Hungarian (1.2) has been added.
- Fix: The fix for the lightbox in 1.2.4 has caused the previous bug in 1.1.3, where a dropdown in the first header menu would appear behind the second header menu, to reappear again.
1.2.4
- Localization: Turkish (1.2) has been added.
- Localization: Italian has been updated to 1.2.3.

- Fix: The Edit in Admin button in IE6 was messed up.
1.2.1
- Fix: The Edit in Admin button always appeared even if nobody was logged in. It now only appears if you are logged in into the WordPress admin.

- Change: Some minor performance optimizations.
- Fix: When the display of time in posts is disabled in the admin, the date would inaccurately append the time without any space or words in between.
- Fix: When the date format of comments was set to the default date format (showing a date instead of the elapsed time), the date was not correctly translated by WordPress. This only occured in non-English WordPress installations.
- Fix: When users had to be logged in to post a comment, the sidebar would be placed below the whole post.
- Fix: There had been some IE6 bugs since version 1.1.3, that appeared with and without IE6 optimization enabled.
1.1.4

1.1.3
- New: It's now possible to add your custom CSS rules via the admin. This will ensure that your custom CSS is not overwritten when you update Arjuna automatically.

- Fix: Modified some minor things in header.php to make it W3C compliant.
1.1.2
- Localization: French has been added.
- Localization: Italian has been updated.
- Change: Designed the Edit link to look similar to the other buttons.
- Change: Updated .POT file.
- Fix: When using Arjuna with WPML, the Home link would always link to the default language (the WordPress root). It now displays the localized home.
- Fix: When some IE8 browsers emulate IE6 for compatibility reasons and Arjuna was set to use IE6 optimization, the website's layout would have some issues. 
1.1.1
- New: It's now possible to disable default widgets in the sidebar when the widget bars are empty. This allows for more flexibility in choosing which sidebars to use. For example, you can now disable default widgets and exclusively use the two-column or single-column sidebar, if you wish so.
- New: Added default styles for headings in posts (heading 2 to 4).
- Change: Improved the backend and the way options are retrieved.

1.0.5
- New: It's now possible to display the author of a post in the post header.
- Change: Changed the display of dates to use the default date format specified in Settings > General instead of using a theme-based, localized date format. This allows for grammatically correct date formats in languages other than English where there is no translation available for Arjuna yet.
- Localization: Italian has been added.
- Localization: Lithuanian has been added.
1.0.4
- Fix: The bug from version 1.0.2 introduced another bug. We reverted the bug. Please refer to the note in the README.txt file.

- Fix: The bottom of the sidebar in IE6 rendered a small part of the RSS icon.
